# {{page.title}}

These internships are aimed at current PhD students looking for an industrial placement of around 5-months with the right to work in the UK.  The projects are focussed on innovation in particular around getting the most value out of NHS data.  They often have a focus on emerging data science techniques and so we advertise mainly to data science programmes however previous interns have included disciplines such as clinical, mathematics, computer science and bioinformatics which have added huge value through the range of approaches and knowledge.

For details around **how to apply** see the Scheme Overview page.
