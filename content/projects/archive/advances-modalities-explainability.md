# AI Safety in Healthcare - Advances in Explainability Across Modalities

**Keywords:**  Explainability, XAI, Images

**Need:**   In recent years, the machine learning community has made significant progress in democratising a wide variety of explainability techniques which help to ‘open the black box’ of complex models.

This project looks to understand how these explainability techniques are being or can be used to help better explain models for  the healthcare domain, identifying where gaps or problems still exist, and where we can consider using open source packages to help understand specific aspects of models with confidence.

The goal of the project is to build up an good undertanding of the available techniques for individual data modalities (or those useful across modalities) and their pros and cons - such as how they interact including robustness, failure modes, and edge cases.  The project also hopes to highlight which techniques are best aimed at different types of user e.g. which techniques are most useful when working as a developer or user of models.  It may also extend to see how best to include these alongside currently available interpretability techniques. 

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:**  
- [Explainable deep learning models in medical image analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13799) 
- [[2010.00711] A Survey of the State of Explainable AI for Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00711)
- [Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/)

**Related Previous Internship Projects:** [Explaining facial skin disease classification using LIME](https://nhsx.github.io/nhsx-internship-projects/explaining-classification-using-lime/)

**Enables Future Work:** Addition of suitable and relevent explainability techinques to development or usage of machine learning models in various healthcare settings 

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** Focus on areas of robustness as well as limitations of available techniques including edge cases and failure modes would be of significant interest 

**Datasets:** Open source datasets with appropriate modality for the techniques under study 

**Desired skill set:** When applying please highlight any experience around explainability techniques, computer vision, natural language processing, deep learning, coding experience (including any coding in the open), and any other data science experience you feel relevant.
