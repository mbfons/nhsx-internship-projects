# Process Mining to Generate Healthcare Pathways

**Keywords:**  Simulation, ProcessMining, Tabular

**Need:**  Process mining techniques have the potential to unlock significant insights in healthcare event driven data.   A recent publication of research challenges in this area can be found in [Enhancing the usability and understandability of process mining in healthcare](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/206429/1/72583680.pdf).  

Ten recommendations were made including RC-5 - “Consider healthcare specificities” which highlights the need to understand underlying indirect conditions on the process, the robustness for temporal changes and the ability to focus on infrequent behaviour.    This project would seek to apply process mining techniques (especially process discovery) to healthcare data in order to build care pathways that reflect both the average and the rare cases appropriately. 

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:** 
- This PhD thesis on [The application of Process Mining to Care Pathway Analysis in the NHS](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/67950/1/Siddiqi-B-2017-PhD-Thesis.pdf) introduces process mining in healthcare and may be useful background reading.  
- The [ClearPath](https://pods4h.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PODS4H_paper_8.pdf) Method for Care Pathway Process Mining and Simulation is a model which aims to address missingness and poor data quality which can often hamper healthcare data flows.   
- This [Process Mining in Python](https://nhs-pycom.net/process-mining-python) blog on the NHS Python Community discusses some available python libraries. 

**Related Previous Internship Projects:** N/A

**Enables Future Work:** [Optimisation and Learning algorithms on patient pathways](https://nhsx.github.io/nhsx-internship-projects/synthea-learning/)

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** Code and report demonstrating the range of considerations that need to be addressed when applying process mining to healthcare data.  Preferably, outcome care pathways would be in a form that could be fed into [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) or similar tool.  

**Datasets:** Possibilities for using event logs from ambulance data, open data, or the emergency care dataset

**Desired skill set:** When applying please highlight any experience around process mining, tool development, coding experience (including any coding in the open), any other data science experience you feel relevant.
