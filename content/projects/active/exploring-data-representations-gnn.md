# Exploring Data Representations:
## Graph Neural Networks		

**Keywords:** Graphs, GNNs, Multi-modal

**Need:**  The complexity and depth of information captured in Electronic Health Records (EHR) requires a variety of methods to analyse.  This project would look to explore graph representations as such a method to gain insight from EHR and other healthcare data sources, using graph databases and neural network approaches to better explore the data, and the interactions with standards such as [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-apis).  Other modern approaches for encoding sequential information would be good to benchmark against e.g. entity embeddings, etc.

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:**   Recent work using graph models to build simpler knowledge discovery systems e.g. to model electronic health records for improvements in diagnostic prediction, or to understand negative drug interactions - this is achieved by storing the information in a format that is closer to reality.  Utilising Graph Data Structures, Embeddings, Graph Neural Networks  as discussed in [Scalable and accurate deep learning with electronic health records](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0029-1) and [Variationally Regularized Graph-based Representation Learning for Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03761), etc.

**Related Previous Internship Projects:** n/a as first year of the scheme.

**Enables Future Work:** These both constitute important steps towards better features for ML/AI solutions such as the recent interest in Graph Neural Networks.   Supports work looking at interoperability.

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** Demonstration of transforming EHR data to Graph based and the value this has for example pieces of analysis.

**Datasets:** Open healthcare datasets with relevant structures with a view to extend to other datasets if successful.  

**Desired skill set:** When applying please highlight any experience around informatics, graph structures, deep learning, coding experience (including any coding in the open), and any other data science experience you feel relevant.
